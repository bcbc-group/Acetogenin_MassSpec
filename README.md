# Acetogenin_MassSpec
Scripts for analyzing mass spectrometry data from annonaceous plants.

standards.R - This file was used to create figures for the standard curve used to determine the acetogenin content of a plant. This may be adapted for similar purposes with some simple edits.

trapezoid.R - This file implements basic background subtraction and parallel processing to integrate the area under a chromatogram for a given set of mzML or mzXML files. 

view_chromatograms.R - This script can be modified to generate plots of chromatograms, either individually or several chromatograms overlayed on the same plot.
